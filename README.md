# cryptography-MysteryTwister
This repository contains a collection of useful items regarding MysteryTwister challenges  (https://mysterytwister.org/).

The first topic we go into detail is the Lorenz SZ42, a rotor machine from World War II. British cryptanalysts called it *Tunny*.

## Tunny
This section contains 5 pdfs:

 - "General_Report_on_Tunny_Part_1_Chapters_1-and_25" is a collection of web pages, combined together as a whole pdf, originally found at the site : http://www.ellsbury.com/tunny/tunny-001.htm.
Its actual title is "General Report on Tunny, With Emphasis on Statistical Methods".
Browsing of this information has to be done page, by page, so I collected them into one single pdf.
- "Tunny_Report_Parts_0,1_Part_2_Chapters_21,22,23,24,25.pdf"
- "Tunny_Report_Part_2_Chapters_26,27,28_Parts_3,4_Part_5_Chapters_51,52.pdf"
- "Tunny_Report_Part_5_Chapters_53,54,55,56,57,58_Parts_6,7,8.pdf", and
- "Tunny_Report_Part_9.pdf".

The later four pdfs contain a collection of web pages, originally found at the site : http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/t/t01/TR01.php. They are split in four pdfs, due to GitHub's 25MB limitation.

This material of information is useful for those interested in the SZ-42 machines, also known as Lorenz cipher, like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher.

MysteryTwister (https://mysterytwister.org/) has several related challenges concerning SZ-42. Currently there are:
- 13 challenges of Level II, named The SZ42 Challenge -- Part 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, and
-  1 challenge, of Level III, named A Heavy SZ42 Challenge -- Part 14
